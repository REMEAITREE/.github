# Remeaitree - Revolutionizing Medical Records

**Remeaitree** is a groundbreaking project aimed at simplifying the management of medical records and enhancing healthcare accessibility. We understand the challenges of handling piles of medical documents, and we believe that modern technology can transform this process for the better.

## Introduction

In our lives, we often deal with various medical documents such as prescriptions, reports, summaries, and bills. The traditional approach of handling and organizing these documents not only consumes time but also results in unnecessary paper waste. With this in mind, we present to you **Remeaitree**.

Our vision is to create a decentralized platform, akin to Digilocker, tailored for the medical field. Using two-factor authentication with Aadhar and phone numbers, users can access a digital repository of their medical history, including reports, prescriptions, and more, all neatly organized with powerful search capabilities.

In our initial version, we are introducing a hospital and subscription-based feature. This includes AI-driven research on disorders using DL/ML techniques. Moreover, we are working towards integrating a video conferencing application for convenient online consultations with doctors. But our ambitions don't stop here. In the future, we plan to implement Blockchain Technology to ensure the security of patient data and integrate with 1mg for direct medication delivery as prescribed by doctors.

## Motivation

We have all witnessed the chaos during medical emergencies, where searching for past reports becomes a nightmare. Sometimes, a patient's medical history is critical for informed decision-making by doctors. To address these challenges and to prevent unnecessary spending, we have harnessed the power of AI for disease detection and verification.

## Objective

Our project's objective is to make medical record management more efficient and accessible. We aim to help both doctors and patients by creating a platform that eliminates the hassle of handling diverse medical documents. By integrating modern technology, particularly AI, with the traditional healthcare system, we hope to provide a seamless experience for all stakeholders.

## Literature Review

Before embarking on this project, we conducted extensive research to ensure its relevance and uniqueness. We found that many hospitals lack centralized systems for record management, particularly in the context of AI integration. Our project aims to bridge this gap by introducing a decentralized system. We are combining AI models for disease detection and are venturing into uncharted territory by implementing Blockchain technology to safeguard patient data.

## Topic of the Work

### System Design / Architecture

**Working Principle**

Remeaitree functions by creating a decentralized website with two-factor verification using Aadhar and phone numbers. Users can log in to the platform to access their medical history, including reports, prescriptions, and more. Our current version introduces a hospital and subscription-based model with AI-based disease research and video conferencing capabilities.

**Expected Results**

- AI-based research on disorders using DL/ML techniques.
- A user-friendly platform to access past medical records with search functionality.
- AI-powered disease diagnosis for added reliability and cost savings.

## Results and Discussion

Our project aimed to develop a decentralized medical record platform accessible via two-factor authentication, making use of Aadhar and phone numbers. In the current version, we introduced Remeaitree, a subscription-based feature allowing users to access their medical history conveniently. We also incorporated AI-based research on diseases, enhancing patient outcomes. The addition of video conferencing for online doctor consultations addresses the need for remote healthcare.

## Conclusion

The results of our project demonstrate the feasibility of a decentralized medical record platform, improving data security and accessibility for patients. AI-driven disease research promises quicker and more accurate diagnoses. In the future, we plan to further enhance the platform's security with Blockchain technology and offer direct medication delivery through 1mg integration. 

In conclusion, Remeaitree has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare sector by providing a comprehensive solution for patients, doctors, and healthcare providers alike. We are committed to making healthcare more efficient and accessible for everyone.
